# 20 Days of Python: Simulating Theories, Facts, and Paradoxes

This repository is a personal challenge to explore and simulate 20 fascinating mathematical, probabilistic, and paradoxical concepts using Python. The goal is to implement one concept each day for 20 days, with a focus on clarity, accuracy, and learning through code.

## Repository Structure

Each listing's folder will contain the following:

- `main.py`: Python script with the simulation or implementation
- `readme.md`: Brief description of the theory/fact and the approach
---

## Objective

- Apply Python to simulate complex and abstract theoretical concepts
- Reinforce understanding through implementation
- Document the journey for learning and sharing

## Disclaimer

This repository is created for educational and illustrative purposes only. Some simulations are simplified and may not represent complete or rigorous mathematical treatments of the underlying theories. Please consult academic sources for formal definitions and proofs.
